# TAMUhack_2026_Robot: Gesture Controlled Car
TECH:

The Brains: Arduino for high-speed sensor processing and Raspberry Pi for high-level logic.

Wireless: NRF24L01 transceivers establishing a low-latency 2.4GHz link.

Engineering: Custom chassis designed from the ground up in SolidWorks.

Movement: L298N Motor Driver managing high-current DC motors.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:

Near-Zero Latency: Overcame signal interference and packet loss to ensure fluid, responsive control.

Hardware Integration: Successfully bridged the gap between SPI communication protocols and motor torque management.

Future Proof: Designed with a roadmap to include Computer Vision object detection and Haptic Feedback for the driver.
